# hai — HAI brand spec

Brand specification used by `audience-preset` when `<brand>=hai`. The
**first-class `hai` command** (including directory convention, CLI exercise
beat, and Humanitarians AI outro) is documented in
`skills/make/hai/SKILL.md`.

## Register — Pragmatist

For busy, mid-career practitioners applying AI in social-impact work. Get
productive fast.

- Lead with **method**: what it is, what it produces.
- State when to use it — the decision trigger.
- **Required**: when NOT to use it and where it fails. This is the AI main
  event. Do not skip or soften.
- Efficient; no personality tax; no academic hedging.

## Irreducibly-Human tangent flavor

0–1 per video (ONLY on a clear opportunity). One bounded aside:
*"This the AI does well. This is the human's — it cannot be handed off."*
A decision boundary, not a sermon. Most reels get none.
